### This mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person. This mod was created as an expansion for the First-Person Mod, but works completely on its own and is fully vanilla/3rd party server compatible(since it's all just visual).
